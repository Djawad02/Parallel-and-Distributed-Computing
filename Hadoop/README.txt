This assignment is done using articles data from the DPLB dataset.
DPLB: https://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/ (Downloadable link)
This contains two different Questions i.e., q1,q2. Each question has its corresponding main, mapper and a reducer file.
The q1 aims at a MapReduce Algorithm (Java Code) to find the number of articles published in each journal
per year from the DBLP articles dataset.
The q2 aims at finding the co-authorship graph from the DBLP dataset. We wish to find the pair of authors who have published article(s) together.
